## Task Overview

With this yearÂ´s shared task, we want participants to go beyond the identification of offensive comments.
To this end, we extend the focus to two other classes of comments that are highly **relevant to moderators and community managers** on online discussion platforms: **engaging comments** and **fact-claiming comments**, meaning comments that should be considered as a **priority for fact-checking**.


### Subtask 1: Toxic Comment Classification (Binary Classification Task)


Still, the detection of toxic content in online online discussions remains challenging and new approaches are constantly being demanded and developed. With this subtask we aim to continue the series of previous GermEval Shared Tasks on Offensive Language Identification.

| message      | Sub_Toxic |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| *"Toxic comment.........."*      | 1       |
| *"neutral comment....................."*   | 0        |


### Subtask 2: Engaging Comment Classification (Binary Classification Task)

In addition to the detection of toxic language, community managers and moderators increasingly express interest in identifying particularly valuable user content, for example, to highlight them and to give them more visibility. That includes rational, respectful, and reciprocal comments that can encourage readers to join the discussion, increase positive perceptions of discussion providers, and can enhance more fruitful and less violent exchange.

 message      | Sub_Engaging |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| *"Engaging comment.........."*      | 1       |
| *"neutral comment....................."*   | 0        |

### Subtask 3: Fact-Claiming Comment Classification (Binary Classification Task)

Beyond the challenge to ensure non-hostile debates, platforms and moderators are under pressure to act due to the rapid spread of misinformation and fake news. 
Platforms need to review and verify posted information to meet their responsibility as information providers and distributors. 
As a result, there is an increasing demand for systems that automatically identify comments that should be fact-checked manually.
Note that this subtask is not about the fact-checking itself or the identification of fake news.
However, the identification of fact-claiming comments is a pre-processing step for manual fact-checking.

 message      | Sub_FactClaiming |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| *"fact-claiming comment.........."*      | 1       |
| *"neutral comment....................."*   | 0        |
